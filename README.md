# go-blockchain-starter

This repository contains a basic implementation of a blockchain using the Go programming language. The implementation covers key concepts such as blocks, proof-of-work, and basic networking. This is a simplified educational example and not intended for production use.


## Introduction

This project showcases the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology using Golang. It demonstrates how blocks are linked together, how proof-of-work is implemented, and how simple networking can be utilized to establish communication between nodes.

For a detailed explanation of the implementation and code walkthrough, please refer to the associated article: [Blockchain Implementation in Golang](https://vrgl.ir/isDp2).
